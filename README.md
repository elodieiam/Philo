# Philosophers Project 🍽️
The Philosophers project at 42 School involves **simulating the classic dining philosophers** problem to explore concepts in concurrency and synchronization. 🧠

This project enhances our understanding of thread management, synchronization techniques, and concurrent programming.

## Features 📋
1. **Thread Management:** Create and manage multiple threads representing philosophers.
2. **Synchronization:** Use mutexes and semaphores to handle resource sharing and avoid deadlocks.
3. **Concurrency:** Implement concurrent behaviors and ensure proper synchronization.

## Objectives 🎯
1. Master thread management and concurrency concepts.
2. Develop robust synchronization techniques.
3. Improve understanding of concurrent programming.

## Installation 🛠️
To explore the Philosophers project: git clone git@github.com:elodieiam/philosophers.git
